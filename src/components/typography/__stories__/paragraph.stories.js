            US-based two-factor wefwef authentication provider Duo Security
            announced this morning that it is in talks to be acquired by
            networking giant Cisco. According to Duo’s press release, Duo will
            become a “business unit” under Cisco’s Security Business Group, and
            current Duo CEO Dug Song will become the unit’s general manager.

            Ars is a happy Duo customer, and we use the product extensively to
            apply 2FA to a variety of our internal services; beyond that,
            several Ars staffers (myself included) use Duo’s free tier to wrap
            2FA around our own personal stuff, like Linux PAM authentication and
            Mac/Windows logins. Duo’s flexibility and ease of use has been a
            huge driver of success for the company, which says it has about
            12,000 customers.

            But the worry here is that Cisco is going to murder the golden
            goose—and, as a former Cisco customer, I’m struggling to feel
            anything but dread about all the ways in which this acquisition
            might kill everything that’s good about Duo.
